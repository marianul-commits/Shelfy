# Shelfy

Shelfy is a personal project aimed at creating a Goodreads clone using Swift and the OpenLibrary API. The main goal of Shelfy is to provide a platform for users to discover and track books, build their virtual bookshelves called Shelfies.

## Features

Shelfy allows users to browse through a vast collection of books retrieved from the OpenLibrary API. Users can view book details, such as title, author, description, cover image, and other relevant information.

### Login and Register 
Users can create accounts on Shelfy by registering with their email and password.

### Settings Page 
The Settings Page will enable users to manage their goal preference(percentage or x/y), app color scheme preference.

### Home Page 
The Home Page will be the central hub of Shelfy, featuring book recommendations, easy access to last tracked book and a leveling system to game-ify the reading habbit

### Search Page 
The Search Page will allow users to search for books by title, author, or by the ISBN code, making it easy to find and keep track of specific books of interest.

### Book Detail View 
The Book Detail View will provide users with more in-depth information about a selected book, including ratings, description, more from that author, and the option to add the book to their virtual bookshelf.
